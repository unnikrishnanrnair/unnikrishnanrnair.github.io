## Hi there! üëã

<img class="avatar" src="https://avataaars.io/?avatarStyle=Circle&topType=ShortHairShortWaved&accessoriesType=Blank&hairColor=Black&facialHairType=BeardLight&facialHairColor=Black&clotheType=Hoodie&clotheColor=White&eyeType=Happy&eyebrowType=RaisedExcitedNatural&mouthType=Default&skinColor=Brown" alt="avatar">

I am interested in working on **Robotics, Computer Vision, Linux, and NLP**.

I did my **[BTech + MS by Research]** in **Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT-Hyderabad** where I worked with [**Dr. Madhava Krishna**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at [**Robotics Research Center**](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/).

I have worked with **Ola Electric, Qualcomm, Swiggy, Feelr, IIIT-Hyderabad and H-Bots**. I have published in conferences like **ICRA, IROS, ECCV(W), NEURIPS(W), IV, ECC**.

Currently I am a **Research Engineer III** at [**Ola Electric**](https://olaelectric.com/) working on **end-to-end interpretable models** for autonomous driving. As part of my work with Ola Electric I was involved in the filing of **2 Patents**. 
- Method and system for estimating appearance and occupancy information in bird‚Äôs eye view. **[202241014338]**
- Method and system to facilitate navigation and behavior planning by autonomous vehicles. **[202141052888]**

I love competing in AI challenges and have had good standings in:
