This page showcases some of my work in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems.


## ABU Robocon 2018

### üèπ Automatic Throwing Robot & Manual Delivery Robot

In **ABU Robocon 2018**, the challenge was inspired by the traditional Vietnamese game N√©m C√≤n. Teams had to design two robots:
- A **manual robot** for fast shuttlecock delivery and positioning.
- An **autonomous robot** to throw shuttlecocks through rings at varying distances and heights, with the final goal being the **Golden Ring**.

Our team of five developed a coordinated robot system with:
- A high-speed **pneumatic throwing mechanism**,
- **Optimized trajectory planning**, and
- **Vision-assisted targeting** with synchronized communication between the robots.

## Autonomous Vehicles at RRC, IIIT-Hyderabad

At the Robotics Research Center (RRC), I contributed to building a **self-driving car from scratch**, working across the full stack:
- Drive-by-wire systems,
- Sensor fusion and localization,
- Planning with **Frenet Frame-based planners**, and
- Perception modules.

We also published multiple papers on autonomous systems and planning strategies.

## Sim2Real ‚Äì NeurIPS DeepRacer

Participated in the **NeurIPS Sim2Real DeepRacer Challenge**, which had two rounds:

- **Round 1: Simulation Only**  
  Models were evaluated on the AWS DeepRacer simulator under OpenAI Gym constraints.

- **Round 2: Sim2Real Transfer**  
  Qualifying models were tested on a real-world track, with higher weight on real-world performance.

## Autonomous Vehicles at Ola Electric

Worked on building **self-driving vehicles for Indian road conditions**, with hands-on contributions in:
- Sensor integration (cameras, LiDAR),
- Calibration (extrinsic and intrinsic),
- Data collection & annotation pipelines,
- End-to-end learning-based planning agents.

### üöó Highlights
